# Why do I need an SDK?

You may frequently wish to incorporate [Rebill](https://rebill.com/)'s payment solution into your website. This method keeps your customers on your domain throughout their transaction, ensuring a consistent and branded user experience.

This is where Rebill's SDK comes into play. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools that lets you integrate Rebill's payment experience into your site, without requiring your clients to navigate away from your page.

This integration method adheres to PCI DSS standards, ensuring the security of customer data. By implementing this solution, you can be confident that customer information is secure and that your company complies with all regulations governing payment information management and processing.

## **Rebill Components**

Our SDK Checkout consists of Rebill Components, which are the building blocks that make up our SDK Checkout. Each component is a component-based and modular UI solution that enables you to easily integrate and implement over 100+ different payment methods. This feature, which we call **Rebill Components**, allows you to embed an iframe element that delegates the responsibility of transaction management to the provided UI interface.

By default and out of the box, this approach and method automatically renders and displays a prebuilt and preconfigured checkout page that enables and allows you to begin and start accepting and processing online payments and transactions right away and immediately, which is completely and fully customizable and configurable to match and meet your specific needs and requirements ([see customization documentation and guide](https://docs.rebill.com/sdk/checkout#display) for more details, information and additional documentation).
