# Why do I need an SDK?

You may frequently wish to incorporate [Rebill](https://rebill.com/)'s payment solution into your website. This method keeps your customers on your domain throughout their transaction, ensuring a consistent and branded user experience.

This is where Rebill's SDK comes into play. It offers a comprehensive suite of tools that lets you integrate Rebill's payment experience into your site, without requiring your clients to navigate away from your page.

This integration method adheres to PCI DSS standards, ensuring the security of customer data. By implementing this solution, you can be confident that customer information is secure and that your company complies with all regulations governing payment information management and processing.

## **Rebill Components**

Our SDK Checkout is composed of and made up of Rebill Components, which are the building blocks and elements that make up our SDK Checkout. Each and every component is a component-based and modular UI solution that enables and allows you to easily and effortlessly integrate and implement the more than 100+ different payment methods that are available and accessible. This feature and functionality, which we call and refer to as **Rebill Components**, enables and allows you to embed and integrate an iframe element, which delegates and transfers the complete and full responsibility of managing and handling transaction management to the provided and included UI interface.

By default and out of the box, this approach and method renders and displays a prebuilt and preconfigured checkout page that enables and allows you to begin and start accepting and processing online payments and transactions immediately, which is completely and fully customizable and configurable to meet your needs ([see customization documentation and guide](https://docs.rebill.com/sdk/checkout#display) for more details and information).
